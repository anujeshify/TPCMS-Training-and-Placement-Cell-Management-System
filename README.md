# TPCMS - Training and Placement Cell Management System

In the present day scenario with increasing amount of incoming job applications, it has become a necessity to have a proficient TPCMS (Training and Placement Cell Management System). Placement cell helps students to know about the industry they are heading into and the main aim of placement cell is to get students placed into virtuous companies. We have designed a TPCMS project for understanding the basic operations that are involved in a TPCMS program.
